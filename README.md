# APIDRIBL #

I am trying to document the public API of dribl.com

the swagger is presented here: https://data-monkey.github.io/apidribl/#/


the dribl app has many concepts that need to be related to each other. 

  * tenant

  * league
  
  * club
  
  * team
  
  * ground
  
  * field
  
  * fixture
  
  * match
  
  * result 
  
  * ladder
  
  * competition


I am still working out the relationships ...
